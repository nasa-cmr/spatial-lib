;; This module constructs orbit geometries as strings of lat/lon edge points by
;; using rotation matrices.  It helps to take a second to visualize the rotations.
;; (It'd help more if I were any good with animation.)
;;
;; Imagine a coordinate system centered on the Earth.
;;   - The positive x axis passes through lat/lon (0, 0)
;;   - The z axis passes through the poles
;;   - the y axis is perpendicular to the x and z axes
;;
;; Take an orbit for a granule with an ascending crossing longitude and time, a
;; temporal range, and collection orbit parameters including period, declination,
;; and swath width.
;;
;; Perform the following steps, imagining the position of the vector, v, touching
;; lat/lon (0, 0) at each step.
;; 1. Rotate the coordinate system around the z-axis by the granule's ascending
;;    crossing longitude.  v is now at lat/lon (0, ascending-crossing-lon)
;; 2. Rotate the coordinate system around the x-axis by the orbit's declination,
;;    which is a typically small number of degrees describing how the orbit is
;;    tilted with respect to the poles.  v doesn't move.
;; 3. For a desired time, t, expressed in seconds offset from the orbit's ascending
;;    crossing time:
;;    a. Determine how many degrees the orbit progresses in time t, based on the
;;       orbit's period.  Rotate that many degrees around the y axis.  v now points
;;       at a position along the orbit's track, uncorrected for the Earth's rotation.
;;    b. Determine how many degrees the Earth rotates in time t.  Rotate backward
;;       that many degrees around the *original* z axis (the axis passing through
;;       the poles).  v now points at the ground-track position of the satellite at
;;       time t.
;;    c. To obtain swath edges, rotate around the z axis +/- half the swath width
;;       in radians.  v now points to the edge of the swath.
;;    d. Multiply the resulting transformation matrices for the swath edges by
;;       <1, 0, 0> to get edge positions.
;;
;; Repeat step 3 for several sample times within the orbit's temporal range at a
;; granularity that balances performance with accuracy to build up lists of swath
;; edge positions.
