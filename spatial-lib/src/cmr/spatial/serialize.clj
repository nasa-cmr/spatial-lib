  "Contains functions for serializing ordinates for storage in an index.

  This converts shapes into two sets of fields containing integers. The fields are:

  * ords - A list of 'ordinates' which is a sequence containing longitude latitude pairs flattened.
    * i.e. lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2, lon3, lat3 ...
    * All of the ordinates from all of the shapes for a given granule will be stored in the same
      ordinates list concatenated together.
  * ords-info - A list of pairs (flattened) of integers that contain type and size. Each pair
    represents one shape in the ords list.
    * type - an integer representing the spatial type (polygon, mbr, etc)
    * size - the number of ordinates in the ords list this shape uses."
